# Want to Play a Game?

## Description

This is a short multiple choice quiz covering a few basic JavaScript facts. The quiz will only give you 30 seconds to complete it, and if you get a question wrong the quiz will deduct 10 seconds from your time remaining. Building this quiz tested my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Multiple choice quizes can be adjusted for any subject material, which will allow me to build on it in the future if I need to.

## Usage

- I had the help of Jennifer Trevino, a TA in my EdX Coding Bootcamp
- I utilized the AI program Xpert Learning Assistant to better clarify my JavaScript code and make it more concise.
